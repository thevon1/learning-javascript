# learning-javascript
> A set of hands on lessons to learn javascript.

The lessons can be found in the [lessons](lessons) directory.  It is recommended that you start at [lesson-1](lessons/lesson-1-comments-whitespace-programs.js) and proceed from there.

The lessons contained herein start off with the Ecmascript 5, or ES5 for short,
syntax of javascript.  Ecmascript 6, or ES6 for short, has been intentionally
left out.  The reasons for this are as follows:

* The fewer the concepts a newcomer has to learn, the sooner they'll be able to write
meaningful programs.
* The features of ES6 will be more fully appreciated when the newcomer understands
the pain points they were meant to address.
* All features of ES5 are supported in every browser and javascript run time at the
time of this writing.  The same cannot be said for ES6.
